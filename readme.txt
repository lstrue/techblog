From lecture 3 to is about Markdown and pagedown editor, 
3 markdown tags
4 pagedown third party app, 5 image responsive - not safe, image can be truncated
pagedown third party: settings install, form, base html(jquery loop all tags), create html(post form), list html, detail html
6 pagedown deux, 7 truncate_html - (so far it's useful for truncating image and other markdown, and make it safe)
settings install, form, model - add markdown method which means markdown interpreting at backend to make it safe, 
base html(don't need that jquery anymore except for responsive image), create html(post form), list html, detail html
-add admin myself
8 implement dynamic preview - don't use in production(otherwise needs to change admin), just a jquery practice
